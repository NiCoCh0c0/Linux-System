# Disk setup to install LFS
## Setup disk
### Partion table and disk partions
In order install an LFS, we need to prepare our disk. First, we setup the disk on GPT label.
If your disk already have a partition table, make sure to erase it. First unmount all partition (check with lsblk then umount all). Then you can use this command to erase the partition table.
```bash
  sudo wipefs -a /dev/<disk>
```
Then, we will create partitions on the disk with the following requirement :
  - boot_efi : 256M - EFI system
  - origin : <A>GB - Linux filesystem
  - swap : 2G - Linux swap

We can use cfdisk utils to make it, don't forget to use GPT for the partition table
```bash
  sudo cfdisk /dev/<disk>
```
Then we can rename our partition using the c option of gdisk
```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/<disk>
```
### Use LVM for origin
In order to extend the system later with other disks, we will use LVM. First we create the physical volume
```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/<partition>
```
Then we create the logical volume name origin add associate it with our physical volume
```bash
sudo vgcreate origin /dev/<pvname>
```
And finish to create our logical volume
```bash
sudo lvcreate -L <A>GB -n slash origin
```
Now our "/" partiton will be accessible on /dev/origin/slash.
  
### Add filesystem to disk partition
We highly recommand using ext2 for boot_efi. For origin, ext4 will be used but other can be consider. Here we will use it. For swap, use the swap partition system.
```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext2 /dev/<partition>
```
```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/origin/slash
```
```bash
sudo mkswap /dev/<partition>
```
## Mount disk
Now let's mount our partition to operate modification
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/lfs/
mount /dev/origin/slash /mnt/lfs/
sudo mkdir /mnt/lfs/boot
sudo mount /dev/<boot_partition> /mnt/lfs/boot
sudo mkdir /mnt/lfs/swap
swapon /dev/<swap_partition>
```
If you will restart your computer, don't forget to remount all or just edit /etc/fstab
